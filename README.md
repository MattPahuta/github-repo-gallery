# GitHub Repo Gallery 

This is my solution to the final project of the [Skillcrush](https://www.skillcrush.com) JavaScript Fundamentals course. 

## Overview
The project is focused on connecting to and pulling data from the GitHub REST API and dynamically populating page elements through event listeners and a search input.

### Project Requirements

Users should be able to:

- View my current GitHub avatar and basic bio
- View up to 100 of my recent GitHub repos
- Select an individual repo to view additional details
- Search by repo name to filter results
